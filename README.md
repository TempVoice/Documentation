### What's a Temporary Channel? <a href="#whats-a-temporary-channel" id="whats-a-temporary-channel"></a>

It’s a voice channel — but with a catch: it only exists as long as someone is using it.

### What can I do with a Temporary Channel?

As the user who joined a creator channel, you become the owner of the temporary channel. As the owner, you can change the channel name and perform other actions using the [/voice](commands/voice/) commands or an [Interface Message](commands/interface.md).
