Dear Discord Support,

I contact you because in my Discord Server is a voice channel which cannot be edited or deleted.

I ask you to please resolve this issue.

Server ID: [your server ID here]
Channel ID: [channel ID here]
```

1. If you see the channels on mobile but not on desktop do this:
   * Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode\
     \
     ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).avif>)
   * Settings -> Scroll Down -> Clear Caches\
     ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).avif>)
