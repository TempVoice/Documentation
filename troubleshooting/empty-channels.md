# Empty temporary channels

## Still found empty temporary channels? <a href="#still-found-and-empty-temporary-channel" id="still-found-and-empty-temporary-channel"></a>

1. Try to join and leave the channel
2. Only if 1. does not work, try to manually delete the channel
3. Only if 2. does not work, create a Discord support ticket with this text:\
   \
   [https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000029212](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029212)

```
Dear Discord Support,

I contact you because in my Discord Server is a voice channel which cannot be edited or deleted.

I ask you to please resolve this issue.

Server ID: [your server ID here]
Channel ID: [channel ID here]
```

## Are you on Mobile?

Try to clear the cache if you see channels on mobile but not on desktop:

* Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode\
  \
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).avif>)
* Settings -> Scroll Down -> Clear Caches\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).avif>)
