# TempVoice not working

## Check if TempVoice is online <a href="#check-the-status-page-and-may-be-patient" id="check-the-status-page-and-may-be-patient"></a>

See if Discord has announced any outage or has an increased api latency here [https://discordstatus.com/](https://discordstatus.com/). You can also join the support server [https://discord.gg/tempvoice](https://discord.gg/tempvoice) and look in [#notification](https://discordapp.com/channels/904322845646135317/916444589622177902) for maintaince/outage announcements.

## Check your DMs <a href="#turn-on-your-dms-and-do-not-block-tempvoice" id="turn-on-your-dms-and-do-not-block-tempvoice"></a>

TempVoice sends you a notification when there was an error creating a temporary channel. Make sure you have DMs enabled and didn't blocked TempVoice.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Ratelimit**

If TempVoice is online, has all permissions and worked fine before, you might experience a ratelimit. This can happen when bots created too many channels in a short time.

This ratelimit will resolve itself after some time.&#x20;
