  Gets replaced by the custom name a user can set for their temporary channel
  using the /voice name command. This allows you to have immutable name parts
  that cannot be changed by the user.
---

# {CUSTOM}

## Example

```
✨・{CUSTOM}
```

If the channel is locked, unlocked or hidden:

```
✨・Pls join me
```

```
✨・I am bored
```

```
✨・We play mc
```

## Customize the placeholder

If the user has no custom name set it will use the users nickname.

This can be changed by clicking on the `{ }` button to open the placeholder overview. Afterwards click on the settings gear next to the placeholder to change its defaults.
