{% hint style="info" %}
Users can adjust this setting for their temporary channel by using the [`/voice bitrate`](../../../commands/voice/bitrate.md) command or [`interface`](../../../commands/interface.md).

To enforce default settings, disable the bitrate [command](../features/restore-owner-settings.md) or the [restore](../features/restore-owner-settings.md) setting.
{% endhint %}
