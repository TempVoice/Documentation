{% hint style="info" %}
Users can overwrite the default user limit of their temporary channel by using the [`/voice limit`](../../../commands/voice/limit.md) command or an [`interface`](../../../commands/interface.md), unless changing the channel limit or the restore feature is disabled.
{% endhint %}

## User Limit Range

The owner of a temporary channel will only be able to set a user limit that is within the range that you have selected.
