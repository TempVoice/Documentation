Use whatever you like as the default channel name for waiting rooms, which can be created by the owner of a temporary channel using [/voice waiting](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/commands/voice/waiting). The default name can contain what we call [Placeholders](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/config/placeholders) that can display information dynamically.
