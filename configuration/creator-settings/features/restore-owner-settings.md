Disable the restore feature for certain properties such as channel name, limit, or privacy.

Users will still be able to change these properties using [/voice name](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/commands/voice/name), [/voice limit](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/commands/voice/limit) and [/voice privacy](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/commands/voice/privacy), but these settings will not be saved, and creating a new temporary channel will use the default configuration of the creator channel.
