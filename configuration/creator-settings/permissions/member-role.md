If your Discord server uses a verification system to prevent @everyone from accessing the server, you may want only a verified role to be able to view temporary channels.

All selected roles will be required to view temporary channels, unless the channels privacy has been changed by the channel owner with [/voice privacy](https://help.tempvoice.xyz/docs/commands/voice/privacy).
