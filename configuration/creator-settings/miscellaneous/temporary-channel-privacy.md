# Temporary Channel Privacy

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can adjust this setting for their temporary channel by using the [`/voice privacy`](../../../commands/voice/privacy.md) command or [`interface`](../../../commands/interface.md).

To enforce default settings, disable the privacy [command](../features/restore-owner-settings.md) or the [restore](../features/restore-owner-settings.md) setting.
{% endhint %}
