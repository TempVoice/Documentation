# Max Temporary Channels

> **Where do I find this?**
>
> Open the [Dashboard](https://tempvoice.xyz/dashboard) -> Select your Discord server -> Select the **correct** Creator Channel -> Click on the `Others` tab -> `Max Temporary Channels`

As soon the limit is reached, a user trying to create another channel, will stay in the Creator Channel and get a notification from TempVoice.

This can be useful if you only allow for specific number of teams having a temporary channel.
