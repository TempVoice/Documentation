This default channel privacy can be changed by the temporary channel owner with [/voice privacy](../../commands/voice/privacy.md) or an [Interface Message](../../commands/interface.md). As soon as the user creates a new temporary channel, the previous privacy mode will be used.

### Don’t want users to change the privacy mode?

Disable it under [Toggle Features](../moderation/features.md).

### Don’t want channels keep their privacy mode after recreation?

Disable it under [Restore Owner Settings](../moderation/restore.md).
