Users will still be able to change these properties using [/voice name](../../commands/voice/name.md), [/voice limit](../../commands/voice/limit.md) and [/voice privacy](../../commands/voice/privacy.md), but these settings will not be saved, and creating a new temporary channel will use the default configuration of the Creator Channel.
