This default channel user limit can be changed by the temporary channel owner with [/voice limit](../../commands/voice/limit.md) or an [Interface Message](../../commands/interface.md). As soon as the user creates a new temporary channel, the previous user limit will be used.

### Don’t want users to change the user limit?

Disable it under [Toggle Features](../moderation/features.md).

### Don’t want channels keep their user limit after recreation?

Disable it under [Restore Owner Settings](../moderation/restore.md).

The owner of a temporary channel will only be able to set a user limit that is within the range that you have selected.
