# Temporary Channel Name

This default channel name can be changed by the temporary channel owner with [/voice name](../../commands/voice/name.md) or an [Interface Message](../../commands/interface.md). As soon as the user creates a new temporary channel, the previous name will be used.

### Donâ€™t want users to rename channels?

Disable it under [Toggle Features](../moderation/features.md).

### Donâ€™t want channels keep their name after recreation?

Disable it under [Restore Owner Settings](../moderation/restore.md).
