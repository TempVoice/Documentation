This default channel bitrate can be changed by the temporary channel owner with [/voice bitrate](../../commands/voice/bitrate.md).&#x20;

### Don’t want users to change the bitrate?

Disable it under [Toggle Features](../moderation/features.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The option "Highest possible" is based on the Boost Level of your Discord server.
