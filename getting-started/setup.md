## ➕ Creator Channel

A voice channel that creates a temporary channel when you join it. You can set up multiple Creators by repeating the steps above. Each Creator has its own configuration for creating temporary channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have multiple ➕ **Creator Channels**, each of which can be configured individually to create temporary channels in different ways.
{% endhint %}

## ✨ Interface Message

A text channel in which the bot sends an [interface](../commands/interface.md) which is an alternative to the [/voice](../commands/voice/) commands and used to customize a temporary channel.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have unlimited ✨ **Interface Messages**. These can either be in a separate channel or sent directly in the chat of a temporary channel with: [Temporary Channel Greeting](../settings/others/greeting.md).
{% endhint %}
