# Restore Owner Settings

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Users will still be able to change these properties using [/voice name](../../../commands/voice/name.md), [/voice limit](../../../commands/voice/limit.md) and [/voice privacy](../../../commands/voice/privacy.md), but these settings will not be saved, and creating a new temporary channel will use the default configuration of the creator channel.
